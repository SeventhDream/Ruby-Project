JAMBI: Hello stranger! Welcome to the humble abode of yours truly, Jambi's Junkyard! And to whom do I owe this surprise visit?
RUBY: My name is Ruby. What's causing all that noise?
JAMBI: Well, unfortunately my trusty clockwork friends who help me run the place have gone haywire.
RUBY: Sounds to me like you could use some new 'friends'.
JAMBI: Nonsense! I built them myself from my own yard, no less! I couldn't bring myself to just throw them away.
RUBY: Suit yourself. Do you know the way back to the main trail? I need to return home.
JAMBI: Certainly! The gate just ahead leads to main road. Merchants use it to deliver their 'goods' to my yard.
RUBY: Right, I forgot we're standing in the middle of a Junkard... Could you open it for me?
JAMBI: I would be glad to, but-
RUBY: Let me guess, your 'friends' are in the way?
JAMBI: Correct.
RUBY: Alright, how do we fix them?
JAMBI: I'm glad you asked! Just grab those cogwheels and throw them using [C]. That should knock their circuits back in order!
JAMBI: At least for now...
JAMBI: If you run out of cogs, there should be more bags lying around the grounds, and strawberries to eat if you're feeling hungry or weak!
JAMBI: You can use [R] to reset if you're feeling stuck.
JAMBI: Return to me when you're done. Good luck!
RUBY: (whispers) What a lazy frog...
JAMBI: Press [TAB] you need to remember the controls or your current objective.
RUBY: Huh?
JAMBI: What are you doing still standing there? The machines won't fix themselves!
RUBY: ...
JAMBI: Zzz... Oh, you're already done! (**Yawn**) That was quick!
RUBY: (Why do I feel like I've been used?)
JAMBI: (**Stretching**) I suppose I should open the gate for you now...
